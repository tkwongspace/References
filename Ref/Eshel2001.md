**ABSTRACT**
Sink-source relationships and allometric ratios were studied in young seedlings of faba bean (_Vicia faba_ L.) following pruning of some root types. The plants were grown in an aeroponic system allowing an easy access to each part of the root system, throughout the experiment, without disturbing the others. Root, leaf and stem growth as well as their mineral content were determined in one group of undisturbed plants (CTRL) and in four groups of plants treated as follows: TAP – the distal-free portion of the taproot was removed; HALF – half the laterals were removed; ALL – all lateral roots were removed, and TAP+HALF – both the distal part of the taproot and half of the laterals were removed. Removal of all the lateral roots (ALL) induced the development of a longer taproot but severely arrested shoot growth. Phosphorus, potassium and calcium contents were lower in the plants of the ALL treatment. However, the content of Mg was practically unaffected. The effect of the HALF treatment was hardly noticeable but the effects of TAP+HALF treatment were cumulative. The allometric relationships between the surface area of the roots and that of the leaves were restored within the experimental period, apparently due to reduction in shoot growth. Removal of the distal parts of the taproot did not cause an increase in shoot growth. This indicates that the strength of the sinks (mostly of lateral roots) rather than that of the source determines these relationships.
