## Basic Information

- 结构性碳水化合物主要用于树木的物理结构生长，而非结构性碳水化合物则作为一种重要的能量储存以支持包括光合作用、生长和胁迫响应等生理代谢过程：Structural carbohydrates primarily contribute to the physical structure of trees, such as wood and bark, while non-structural carbohydrates serve as a vital energy reserve that supports metabolic processes, including photosynthesis, growth, and stress responses [(Doughty *et al.*, 2014)](Ref/Doughty2014).
- 有研究发现，正在经历干旱的植物，其叶片和木制部分的非结构性碳水化合物含量依然保持稳定，即便叶片的光合速率已经出现明显下降，说明树木能够在胁迫状态下存在一定的分配策略以维持基本的生长和代谢过程： [Janssen *et al.* (2020)](Janssen2020.md) found that during periods of drought, while leaf photosynthesis may decline significantly, the concentrations of NSCs in both leaf and wood tissues remain relatively stable. This stability suggests that trees can maintain their growth and metabolic functions even when photosynthetic rates are reduced, indicating a strategic allocation of carbon reserves to NSCs during stress events.

## Factors

- 树木中与水分传导相关的性状能够调节非结构性碳水化合物含量以应对干旱条件：[Brum *et al.* (2021)](Ref/Brum2021) investigated the seasonal and interannual dynamics of NSCs in eastern Amazon tree species, revealing that trees with effective hydraulic traits can modulate NSC concentrations in response to drought conditions.
