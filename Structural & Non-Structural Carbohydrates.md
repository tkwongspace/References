## Basic Information

- 权衡存在于自然选择下共享有限资源的性状之间，关注的是植物的碳分配，即如何分配有限的碳资源用于代谢、生长、繁殖和防御方面的需求：Trade-offs define the limits of life ([Futuyma & Moreno, 1988](Ref/FutuymaMoreno1988); [Agrawal *et al.*, 2010](Ref/Agrawal2010)) and maintain biological diversity at multiple scales of organisation (e.g., [Vellend & Geber, 2005](Ref/VellendGeber2005)). Trade-offs commonly form when natural selection acts simultaneously on multiple traits that share finite energetic resources ([Mooney, 1972](Ref/Mooney1972); [Agrawal *et al.*, 2020](Ref/Agrawal2020)).... The importance of trade-offs has thus led to decades of research on how woody plants partition their limited supply of carbon amongst the competing demands of metabolism, growth, reproduction, and defence - referred to as carbon allocation ([Mooney, 1972](Ref/Mooney1972); [Hartmann *et al.*, 2020](Hartmann2020)). 
- 结构性碳水化合物主要用于树木的物理结构生长，而非结构性碳水化合物则作为一种重要的能量储存以支持包括光合作用、生长和胁迫响应等生理代谢过程：Structural carbohydrates primarily contribute to the physical structure of trees, such as wood and bark, while non-structural carbohydrates serve as a vital energy reserve that supports metabolic processes, including photosynthesis, growth, and stress responses [(Doughty *et al.*, 2014)](Ref/Doughty2014).
- 有研究发现，正在经历干旱的植物，其叶片和木制部分的非结构性碳水化合物含量依然保持稳定，即便叶片的光合速率已经出现明显下降，说明树木能够在胁迫状态下存在一定的分配策略以维持基本的生长和代谢过程： [Janssen *et al.* (2020)](Janssen2020.md) found that during periods of drought, while leaf photosynthesis may decline significantly, the concentrations of NSCs in both leaf and wood tissues remain relatively stable. This stability suggests that trees can maintain their growth and metabolic functions even when photosynthetic rates are reduced, indicating a strategic allocation of carbon reserves to NSCs during stress events.
- 欧洲冷杉在不利光照条件下会下调与光合及生长相关的生理活性，但会上调与淀粉和糖类合成相关的通路：Under negative carbon balance, photosynthesis and growth are down-regulated while sucrose and starch biosynthesis pathways are up-regulated, indicating that trees prioritise carbon allocation to storage over growth [(Huang *et al.*, 2021)](Ref/Huang2021).

## Mechanisms

- 关于植物如何储存不稳定的非结构性碳水化合物已经有很长的讨论历史：How storage, or the labile, nonstructural carbohydrates (NSCs) residing in woody tissues, is related to growth and thus factors into trees' carbon budgets, has been long debated ([Chapin *et al.*, 1990](Ref/Chapin1990); [Kozlowski, 1992](Ref/Kozlowski1992); [Korner, 2003](Ref/Korner2003); [Sala *et al.*, 2012](Ref/Sala2012); [Dietze *et al.*, 2014](Ref/Dietze2014)).
- 被动积累的假说认为，非结构性碳水化合物的储存在树木碳分配中具有最低的优先级，即在植物满足所有碳汇需求后，NSC作为光合产物的副产品被积累起来。尽管许多证据并不支持这一假说，但NSC的积累在许多植物物种模型中依然被视为是被动过程：Passive accumulation posits that storage is the lowest priority sink and accumulates as the by-product of photosynthesis after other sink demands are filled. According to this hypothesis, storage is a plastic trait that increases only if there is a surplus of supply after growth, defense, reproduction, and all other carbon demands are met. Although evidence against this hypothesis is increasing ([Sala *et al.*, 2012](Ref/Sala2012)), storage pools are generally represented as passive in most plant models, where carbohydrates accumulate only after other needs are met ([Le Roux *et al.*, 2001](Ref/LeRoux2001); [Dietze *et al.*, 2014](Ref/Dietze2014)).
- 主动积累假说认为，NSC储存作为一个具有竞争力的碳汇，在进化中成为生长-生存权衡中以牺牲生长为代价的积累过程。它可以通过上调细胞中的碳水化合物储存实现，也可通过下调生长及其他碳汇的碳需求实现，因此有时也称之为“类主动储存”：Active accumulation is that storage is a competing sink in itself and has evolved to accumulate at the expense of growth as part of a growth-survival trade-off (e.g., [Wright *et al.*, 2004](Ref/Wright2004); [Reich & Cornelissen, 2014](Ref/ReichCornelissen2014)). Active accumulation could be achieved by an upregulation of carbohydrate storage in cells or a downregulation of growth or other carbon sinks, sometimes referred to as 'quasi-active storage' ([Sala *et al.*, 2012](Ref/Sala2012); [Dietze *et al.*, 2014](Ref/Dietze2014)).
- 如果主动积累假说成立，意味着NSC储存是一个可遗传的性状，通过适应性选择或基因组调控形成。无论是何种过程，其都是两种性状之间基因调控碳分配权衡的结果，并将进一步遗传给后代，即高储存慢生长的个体后代将储存更多且生长更慢，反之亦然：To evolve, storage must be a heritable trait (i.e., variation is genetic and can be passed onto offspring) that can be selected to increase at the expense of growth ([Chapin *et al.*, 1990](Ref/Chapin1990)). Such a genetic trade-off indicates a relationship formed by either adaptive selection or a genomic constraint. In either case, the relationship is the result of a genetic trade-off between two traits that is passed onto offspring (high storers and low growers will beget higher storing and lower growing offspring and vice versa).
- 基于主动积累假说，植物物种在NSC储存上的表现差异可以落在植物生活史性状的竞争-寿命轴上，而且在NSC储存上投入更高的物种将采取一种更保守的对冲策略，从而更适应随机或极端环境：Given the active storage hypothesis, we predict the investment in storage to fall along a competition vs longevity spectrum of plant life-history traits, where an abundant investment in storage as part of a conservative, bet-hedging strategy provides a fitness benefit in more stochastic or extreme environments ([Blumstein *et al.*, 2022](Ref/Blumstein2022)).

## Factors

- 树木中与水分传导相关的性状能够调节非结构性碳水化合物含量以应对干旱条件：[Brum *et al.* (2021)](Ref/Brum2021) investigated the seasonal and interannual dynamics of NSCs in eastern Amazon tree species, revealing that trees with effective hydraulic traits can modulate NSC concentrations in response to drought conditions.
